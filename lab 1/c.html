        When the de-regulation blueprint of the Indian oil industry was announced in 1997, the world took note of the
        enormous potential that India offered in terms of business. From a controlled field of business to one where
        petrol and its products have been branded and are being positioned to attract the maximum number of consumers,
        the petroleum industry has come a long way.<ul>
